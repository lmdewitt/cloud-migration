  * staff departure

### Goals
  * data preservation
  * increase collaboration
  * reduce data silos

### Considerations
  * users
  * size of data
  * need specific application?
  * data organization?
  * actively worked on or just needing archiving?
  * complexity
  * find-ability
  * potential cost
  
  
### Also need more details in the flow about
  * Is your data one of the Strategic Initiatives? Then it goes elsewhere… 
  * whether analysis can/should be done locally or will need to have the data in the cloud for the analysis.
  * Address google workstations… ? 
  * What else? 
  * Could be customized for the FMCs who have data in OCI. 
  * and/or if you have a relevant app that is in aws/azure altho again that’s not primary for most. 
  * Also adding in the EDM group’s high priority initiatives (preservation data)
