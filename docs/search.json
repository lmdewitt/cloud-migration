Then it goes elsewhere…\nwhether analysis can/should be done locally or will need to have the data in the cloud for the analysis.\nAddress google workstations… ?\nWhat else?\nCould be customized for the FMCs who have data in OCI.\nand/or if you have a relevant app that is in aws/azure altho again that’s not primary for most.\nAlso adding in the EDM group’s high priority initiatives (preservation data)\n\n\n\nPotential resources:\nhttps://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/data/tools/which-data-tool-right-for-you\nhttps://nmfs-opensci.github.io/ResourceBook/\nhttps://github.com/orgs/nmfs-openscapes/projects/46/views/6?pane=issue&itemId=102584748&issue=nmfs-openscapes%7Chow-we-work%7C35\nhttps://2025julyesipmeeting.sched.com/event/25ehj/archive-your-first-or-second-data-set-south-room-3rd-flr\nhttps://intertidalagency.github.io/ia-guides-resources/repository_criteria.html\nhttps://guide.cloudnativegeo.org/\nhttps://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/\n\n\nNotes: Decision tree for moving on-prem data to the cloud\n\nDecision tree for where people can and should move their data. How to process and where to work with your data - e.g. can be archived or needs to be actively accessed\n\nWIP Wiki: https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/cloud-data-guide/wiki\n\nLynn shared the tree they started\nClarifying Questions\n\nIs there a particular cloud people are moving their data to?\n\nNot yet, that is what they are hoping to achieve. People have it spread across multiple platforms (AWS or Google)\nGoogle Cloud Platform, AWS\n\nGoal to have the decision tree nationwide?\n\nHope so - some bigger data groups have already shifted (i.e. passive acoustics)\n\n\nLucid Chart Interactive starting point for contributing to the decision tree\nComments\n\n[Brian] - great idea; I’m aware of the plan to abandon LANs but had no idea there are multiple options to consider. A nice graphic flow chart could be very helpful.\n[Brooke] I wonder what the biggest blockers are here. I’m a data consumer rather than a data producer in my current role (so no firsthand experience within NMFS), and I’m wondering how many of the blockers are due to lack of training / awareness, organizational siloes, fear around losing data or needing to move it again as contracts and funding change.\n[Erin R] - NASA Openscapes supported this kind of work and has a “when to cloud”\n[Erin R] ESIP Cloud cluster may also have more general resources\n[Breakout room] Potential barriers regarding metadata and data tracking for data users\nIssue: as a data user, finding information on most recent data, recent update date\n\nSolution: Have tree for both sides - data creators and data users\nIssue: as a data creator, multiple versions under multiple divisions\nSolution: Create single solution with directory\n\n\nGroup Discussion\n\nWhat are the considerations for choosing a cloud and decisions generally?\nYou have data and you need to move it to the cloud - where do you put it?\n\nToo many cloud options at this time\n\n\nPeople who need to use data - where do they find it?\nStoring data - by divisions and people\n\nMove to categories of data for storage\nShifting to scientific silos/categories for data compared to the individual or division silos\nE.g. trawl surveys, ecosystem data - what categories make sense?\nOr perhaps type vs. size ? Categorize based on size instead\nWhere do we find data if we categorize it by descriptive characteristics?\n\nDashboard & documentation to find specific data\nSeparate finding the data (living and updated document) and storing the data\n\nWould be nice to be able to find all of the “X” type of data if doing a larger study, for example finding all of the hake data\n\n[Erin S] - /https://media.fisheries.noaa.gov/dam-migration/04-111.pdf - a lot of this diagram reminds me out the mental gymnastics involved with sorting out cloud data storage - maybe we can leverage the thinking there?\nHow will data be accessed? Is it used for collaboration? How large is it? Privacy requirements?\nWhen getting to the use of the data actively and its upkeep the tree diverges and becomes more complicated\nWe can work on adding to the bottom of the tree or we can go deeper on some of the existing decisions\nActively worked on - why should we separate it ? we can create a reproducible and documented workflow for if anyone wants to use the data at any time\n\nActively worked on is a distinction that may help due to time sensitivity and storage requirements\n\nHow large? How active? Defining these components\nDiscoverability - do you want people to be able to use and access the data? Is it more protected?\nArchived versus served even if data is no longer being updated. Archived might not necessarily mean easy to access or might require downloading. Does data need a DOI?\nDoes it need to be AI ready? If so that means GCP probably.\nListing specific applications\nDirected to use Google Cloud Platform due to deal provided to NOAA\n\nUse Cases - applications\n\nA questionnaire or survey would be helpful to gauge the scientists for which cases are most relevant\n\nGIS applications\nQAQC for cruise data)\nOther applications could have similar issue\n\n\nWhat do we want to understand better?\n\nCloud options and the technical and financial logistics associated with cloud platforms and usage\nWho are the users at this time? In the future?\nHow large are the data?\nIs it a one off data set or a long term time series?\nArchived vs. actively worked on\nDoes it require specific connections (e.g. APIs)?\nWill it exist beyond the tenure of the person working on it? (data preservation)\nAccessibility, discoverability\nComplexity - excel spreadsheet vs. alternate format; single vs. many files\nWhen people can work on their personal computers - but also needs to be documented and shared where necessary",

Highly configurable access controls, involves direct costs, requires more technical expertise).\n\n\nPersistence\n\nIf the data/file needs to persist beyond an individual’s tenure is for a defined team, store in a Google Shared Drive. Best for collaborative projects, data/files shared among a defined team, or data/files that need to persist beyond an individual’s tenure. Controlled access, included in Google Workspace, suitable for long-term preservation, though subject to Google Drive limitations for extremely large data/files.\nIf not, re-evaluate Google Drive Personal Folder or GCP",
